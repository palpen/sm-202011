## Building the development environment using conda

We will use the conda package manager to setup our development environment. You can download the software [on this page](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

Once installed, build the environment by running:

```
cd sm-202011
conda env create
```

Once all the packages have been installed, activate it by

```
conda activate sm-202011
```

## Project 1: Loan Defaults

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict which customers will default on their loan. This project has many of the challenges you might encounter on data science projects in industry: missing records, categorical variables, label you must create yourself. It's a fun problem that is also directly revelant to the banking industry.
