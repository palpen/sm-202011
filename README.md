## Building the development environment using conda

We will use the conda package manager to setup our development environment. You can download the software [on this page](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

Once installed, build the environment by running:

```
cd sm-202011
conda env create
```

Once all the packages have been installed, activate it by

```
conda activate sm-202011
```
